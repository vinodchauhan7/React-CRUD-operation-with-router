This project is for absolute beginners who wants to understand how CRUD operations can be coded in react with simple 'state' & 'props' with 2-Way data-binding and Event handling. I have also use basic forms in order to understand the overall processing of Data.

By default we have 3 users : 
1) (admin/admin) [user credentials]: If you logged In with this credentials then you can see all other users. As a admin you are also able to modify/delete other users.
2) (vinod7/vinod) : That's the credentials of other users in which you can see his details.

There is also a signUp page where you can add more user in this app which will be presist only during the running state of the app.

I have divide this app in 5 lesson (Branches), so that beginners can understand react.
